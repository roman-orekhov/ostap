A clone of ostap to build hascol ("coolkit"). This clone builds ok with camlp5 version 7.00. 

Maybe some commit of camlp5 in between versions 6.17 and 7.00 is also ok, nobody is sure. 

Using camlp5 6.17 and 6.16 forces you to add unnecessary calls of "camlp5o pr_o.cmo" to the build process of ostap.
